# WhatIsYourKeyboardKey

**WhatIsYourKeyboardKey** is a simple and interactive web application designed to display the key code of any key pressed on the keyboard. It features a modern UI with dynamic styling, dark mode support, and a draggable history box that records recent key presses.

## Features

- **Key Press Detection**: Displays the key pressed and its corresponding key code in real-time.
- **Interactive Display**: Highlights the displayed key code with animations to enhance user experience.
- **History Box**: Records and displays a history of recent key presses, which can be dragged around the screen.

2. **Draggable History Box**:

   - You can drag the box using your mouse. The position is constrained within the screen’s visible area to prevent it from going out of view.

3. **Dark Mode Toggle**:
   - Use the toggle switch to switch between dark and light modes.
   - The text color automatically changes to ensure readability in both modes.

4. **Clear History**:
